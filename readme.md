About Me
Hi, My name is Pramesh Kumar, I am Automation Tester having around 8 years of total work experience in web testing and automation using Java programing language. i worked on different projects for varioud companies.

Technologies Used
Java 11: Programming language for automation scripts.
TestNG: Testing framework to execute tests and manage STLC
Page Object Model (POM): Design pattern to enhance test maintainability and reusability.
ExtentReports: Used for generating Detailed and interactive HTML reports for test results.
Log4j: Library used for logging information, debug, and error messages during test execution.
Gson: For data serialization and deserialization, particularly for data-driven testing.
Apache POI: To read and write data to/from Excel files (used for data-driven testing).
Faker Library: to generate for fake test data for Test cases

Features
Data-driven testing using Excel, CSV, and JSON files.
Rich reporting with screenshots, logs, and custom reports.
Flexible logging to capture detailed information during test execution.
Customization hooks via TestNG listeners.
Fake test data generation with Faker library.
Page Object Model design to enhance test maintainability and reduce code duplication.
Cross Browser Testing :- used different Browsers to run the Tests on different environment on cloud plateform i.e LambdaTest
Headless Mode - headless browser is used for faster execution of tests.


Prerequisites
Java 11 or higher should be installed on your machine.
Maven for dependency management and building the project.
IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for code development and execution.
Conclusion

This automation framework is designed to be highly flexible, scalable, and maintainable. It provides easy integration with different testing tools and libraries, and can be extended to fit the needs of a growing test suite.
